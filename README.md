# Mendix on Azure Kubernetes Service

This how-to outlines how to deploy a scalable, production-ready Kubernetes cluster for hosting Mendix apps on Microsoft Azure. The solution includes all components necessary to succesfully build and operate Mendix apps on Azure and consists of the following components:

![Mendix on Azure](mendixazure.png)

## Features of the solution:

- Host Mendix apps in a secure, scalable and managed environment.
- Utilize standard Azure services to ensure cost-effectiveness
- Utilize Azure  DevOps for automated deployments, fully in control of your team

## How to deploy

### Prerequisites

- Account with Owner role assignment on the target Azure Subscription.


### Deploying Container Platform (Azure Kubernetes Service)

The Mendix apps will run in Docker containers which will be orchestrated using Kubernetes. For this purpose we are going to deploy Azure Kubernetes Service, which will provide us with a managed Kubernetes cluster to host our app containers.

#### Deploying Azure Kubernetes Service

1. Sign in to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com).
2. Start the wizard to create an Azure Kubernetes Service.
3. Fill out the basic information:
   * **When choosing node size:** keep in mind that Mendix containers typically need relatively more memory vs. CPU. So choosing instance sizes with a higher memory to CPU ratio tends to be more cost efficient (e.g. E2s_v3).

4. Fill out the scaling information:
   * **With regards to enabling Virtual Nodes:** The Virtual nodes option allows container to be directly scheduled on [Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/). We will not use this option in this how-to. Since Mendix containers typically run 24/7, using VMs as dedicated agent nodes is typically more cost-effective.
   * **With regards to enabling VM Scale Sets:** We will not enable VM scale sets in this how-to as the feature is stil in Preview. It promises a lot more flexibility and can be valuable in the future.
5. Fill out the authentication information:
   * **With regards to enabling RBAC:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows you to define security roles within the cluster and assign different cluster permissions to different groups of users, enabling this is required in order to run a secure cluster.

6. Fill out the network information:
   * **HTTP Application routing:** we disable this as we will deploy an NGINX ingress controller that supports HTTPS later.
   * **Network configuration:** we will select Basic to deploy to a newly created VNet. Specifying an Advanced network configuration is required when we want to deploy to a custom VNet (e.g. a VNet routable over an ExpressRoute).

 7. Fill out the monitoring information
    * Enable this to use the built-in cluster monitoring features of Azure.

 8. Optionally, fill out tags (e.g. for cost tracking)
 9. Confirm your choices to start deployment of the cluster

#### Connecting to the Kubernetes cluster

1. After the deployment of the Kubernetes Service,  a resource group will have been created containing the cluster object:


![Monitoring options](images/clusterobject.png) 

2. [Open the Kubernetes Dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/nl-nl/azure/aks/kubernetes-dashboard) 
3. The cluster has been deployed successfully and can be managed from your workstation!

### Deploying the cluster load balancer (NGINX Ingress Controller)

Web traffic has to flow from outside the cluster towards the right Mendix containers in the cluster. In the Kubernetes world, this is handled by an ingress controller. We will deploy the NGINX ingress controller into the cluster. We will do this using helm, the package manager for Kubernetes.

##### Installing Helm

1) Install helm: [https://helm.sh/](https://helm.sh/)

2) Add helm to your system PATH (see [https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/) for instructions on Windows)
3) Create a service account for Tiller, as described [here](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/rbac.md#tiller-and-role-based-access-control)
4) Initialize Tiller (the server-side component of Helm) on the cluster by running: 

> helm init --service-account tiller

### Installing NGINX Ingress Controller

1. Install NGINX into the cluster by running:

>     helm install stable/nginx-ingress

 ![Helm output](images/helmoutput.png)
 
 2. (Optional) In case you deployed on an internal VNet, be sure to add the _service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"_ annotation as outlined here_:_ [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/internal-lb](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/internal-lb)
 3. After a few minutes, run: 

> kubectl get services â€“output wide

4. The output should contain the external IP address of the load balancer

5. By opening this URL in your browser, you can verify communication from your workstation to the cluster is fully functioning:

### Setting up build and release pipelines using Azure DevOps

We will use Azure Devops to automatically deploy the following components:

 - Azure SQL Server & Elastic Pool
 - Azure Container Registry
 - Azure Keyvaults (for master secrets and app-specific secrets)
 - An app onboarding pipeline (for adding new apps to the cluster, it will deploy per app: databases, Azure Blob Storage Accounts,key vaults, build & release pipelines)

#### Setting up an Azure DevOps project

In this how-to we will use Azure DevOps as a CI/CD solution to execute the pipelines. If you know what you are doing, any other CI/CD solution (e.g. Jenkins, Gitlab) can be used instead. But this how-to accompanies fully-working templates for  Azure DevOps.  A free version of Azure Devops can be obtained by creating a new account at [https://dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com) .

**Setting up the Mendix Azure DevOps project:**

 1. Login to your Azure DevOps environment and create a new project called *Mendix*.
 2.  We need to install some extensions which we will use in our pipelines. This has to be done in the organizational settings pane of Azure Devops. Please install the following extensions from the Azure DevOps marketplace:

3. Next, we need to create several Service Connections in our Azure DevOps project and write down the corresponding GUIDs so that they can be leveraged in the pipelines. All service connections
